# Rotations Overview

Rotations are deterministic helpers that choose actions from a prioritized list when conditions allow.

## Rotations do
- pick the highest-priority usable action
- respect cooldowns, mana checks, range, and conditions

## Rotations do NOT
- change the outcome of rolls
- “decide” story outcomes
- override GM intent

## Common blockers
- silence prevents casting
- mez prevents actions
- rooted prevents closing range
