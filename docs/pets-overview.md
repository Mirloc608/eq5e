# Pets Overview

## Ownership
Players can control their own pets through socket-backed APIs (no GM click required), while GMs still see pet status cues.

## Stances
- **Assist**: follows owner’s target and contributes
- **Guard**: defends owner / holds targets more aggressively
- **Passive**: avoids initiating actions

## Why a pet might not act
- Mez / stun / root / silence
- Out of range and closing
- No valid target
- No mana for its rotation

## Pet equipment
Pets can have dedicated equipment slots. Some pets can cast spells using deterministic rotations.
