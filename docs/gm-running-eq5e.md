# GM: Running EQ5e

## Use the HUD
- Threat indicators help you see who is at risk
- CC panels show mez/root/snare/slow status and remaining rounds
- Parse tools export snapshots for bug reports

## When to override
- Scripted boss mechanics
- Cinematic moments
- When a bug clearly misbehaves (export a report)

## What to emphasize to players
- Aggro management matters
- CC is not “optional flavor”
- Pull discipline wins fights
