# EQ5e Rules Differences (vs D&D 5e)

## Threat and Aggro
EQ5e uses an explicit **threat table** per hostile NPC. Damage, healing, taunts, and certain abilities generate threat. Mobs generally attack whoever has the most threat.

## Crowd Control is First-Class
Mez, root, snare, slow, and silence are modeled as system conditions. Effects can break on damage when appropriate (e.g., mez/charm checks).

## Mana Pacing
Casters are designed around **sustained play**, not nova rounds. Spell ladders progress in tiers; efficiency stays within a consistent range.

## AAs are Long-Term Specialization
Alternate Abilities are not feats. They represent rank-based progression and specialization, often with multiple ranks and prerequisites.

## Pets
Pets are controllable and can act with deterministic AI. Their behavior is constrained by stance, CC, mana, range, and threat rules.
