EQ5E Weapons Catalog (core)
- Drop these files into your Foundry Data/systems/eq5e folder, preserving paths.
- This populates bundles/eq5e-items-core/data/weapons.json used by eq5e-items-core/scripts/main.js
- On next Foundry startup (as GM) it will upsert items into the world.eq5e-weapons compendium.
